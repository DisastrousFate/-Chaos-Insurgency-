Code built and designed for the 2024-2025 season of VEX V5 VRC 'High Stakes'
Written by Alexander Halesworth, with the aid of Oliver McGlade, this was the framework that enabled our team 'Chaos Insurgency' to establish a place in VEX UK Nationals.
We believe that our code was the reason why we were able to score the joint top UK skills points in a regional qualification tournament.

The codebase never had time to properly flourish due to time restricions..
